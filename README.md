# iss-notification
Notify me if the International Space Station is above me, is dark, and is weekend. 

Usually during my weekends, I often try to take a break from notification-pollution and go to a place where there is no internt connection with my old Nokia dumb-phone. I build this tool to notify myself if the ISS was flying above me. 

Work in progress. Left to add SMS notifidation feature.
